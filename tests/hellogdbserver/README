This test shows how to debug a program by launching
the program using gdbserver and having Seer attach to
the gdbserver.

In one window, launch the program using gdbserver.

    $ gdbserver :1234 hellogdbserver

In another terminal, start Seer with the project file.

    $ /usr/local/bin/seergdb -xxx -s --project project.seer

The project file has the info that Seer needs.

    - Program name
    - Debug filename
    - gdbserver port


When exiting Seer, make sure to enter this command into the
gdb command field. Otherwise, the gdbserver process will hang
and you will need to 'kill -9' the gdbserver process.

    (gdb) monitor exit

It tells the gdbserver to shutdown. If you don't, the gdbsver
process will need to be kill with "kill -9".
